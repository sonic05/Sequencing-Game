# Sequencing-Game
A simple sequencing game

This was coded in Python using Kivy library. 

The player is shown a board of squares with a labeled start and finish. A random sequence of squares is shown one by one running from start to finish.

The sequence is shown twice and then disappears. The player then has to click on each square in the sequence in the order that it appeared. If the player gets it right, they continue to the next sequence. If theyâ€™re wrong, the correct square is shown, the sequence is shown again, and the board resets.

As the game progresses, the board gets bigger and the sequences get more difficult.
